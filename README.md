# surfs_up

## Overview
The objective of this module was to learn SQLite using SQLAlchemy to connet and query the data. Also we learn how create apps using flask and python functions, this to run in a local host and show information.

>Analysis

The objectivo of the analysisi was to understand temperatures between June and Decemebr, in order to advice the investors for a new surf shop if the weather conditions would be firndly enough to open a new shop in the area. 
Temperature and precipitation were used as the key dimensions to make the analysis.

The Higher temperature in June is 85 and the mean is 75F in June. The average prcp is .13 

>December Analysis

The Higher temperature in December is 83 and the mean is 71F in June. The average prcp is .21 

### Disclaimer
(The Precipitation metric in weather data tells us total amount of any precipitation that reach the ground during the time period. In the case of rain, this is simply the number of millimeters, centimeters, or inches of water that hit the ground at a given point.)

### Results
The numbers between june and december aren't that different, so we could assume that if that's the average weather conidtions in Hawaii thigs won't change much in the lapse of 6 months. 

Knowing the precipitation amount in december also gives us a advantage in planning the location of the shop.

Using this databases to comapre data bewtween them, it's a huge advantage. It let us understand data and make predictions based on real information analysis.

 June seems to behave in a more similar fashion in the recordings.

December seems to behave average as well, but we can see that there exists an outlier in the plot. I wouln't recomend dismiss it immediatley but still itÂ´s not a constant so I wouldn't be concerned as a crucial factor for decision making.
